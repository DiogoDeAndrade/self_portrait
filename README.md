# DIOGO

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme is "Self Portrait". And yes, the name of the game is Diogo.

## Game

![GameScreenshot](screenshots/screen01.png)

The game has a series of minigames, connected to a photo. Each represents a facet of my personality and together form my self portrait.
The fact that most facets of my personality are expressed to games shows the overarching theme of my life: games.
Current games are:

- Car Chase: When I was little I wanted to be a ambulance driver
![GameScreenshot](screenshots/screen08.png)
- Cat Game: I'm a cat dad (4 and counting!)
![GameScreenshot](screenshots/screen03.png)
- Coder: Programming is love, programming is life
![GameScreenshot](screenshots/screen06.png)
- Music: I can't be without music, and I used to sing and play the guitar
![GameScreenshot](screenshots/screen07.png)
- Teacher: I'm a teacher and I love it
![GameScreenshot](screenshots/screen05.png)
- Typewriter: I love writing
![GameScreenshot](screenshots/screen04.png)
- Lego: Well, self-explanatory!

Finally, if you fail three times, you get a heart attack (I did in 2023), so you have to play the heart attack minigame to continue playing!

Took me longer than I wanted making this, since it's basically 8 games in one, and even with them being very simple, it always takes a bit to make them, especially the art (yep, even when it's bad!).
